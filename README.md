# Satellite-Formatter
Several Python and Javascript based workflows to turn satellite imagery into longitudinal dataframes. 

Javascript files should be run in Google Earth Engine (https://code.earthengine.google.com/). These manage the loading, analysis, and exporting of satellite imagery to .csv files. 

Python files clean and format the .csv outputs of the remote sensing analysis.
